## [1.6.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Added dynamic category permission checking and display:
    - If a user lacks permission for a category, the error message now indicates which permission is required.
    - Supports both the default permission (`ultrasts.join.<id>`) and custom permissions set via the category's `permission` field.
- Added translatable strings to `Lang.java` (generating `lang/en_us.json` automatically):
    - `noPermissionCategory`: Custom error message for category permission failures (with `%permission%` placeholder).
    - `cannotJoinCategory`, `errorSellingPokemon`, `cannotSellPokemon`: Error messages for single-pokemon selling menu.
    - `noPokemonSelected`, `errorProcessingSale`, `noValidPokemonSold`: Error messages for multi-pokemon selling menu.
    - `errorLoadingProfile`: Error message when failing to load user profiles in GUI menus.
    - `reloadSuccess`: Custom reload command success message.
    - `unknownUser`: Fallback for unknown user names in the leaderboard.

### Changed

- Replaced all hardcoded string literals inside menus (`STSMenu`, `STSSellMenu`, `STSCategoryMenu`, `ProfileMenu`, `LeaderBoardMenu`) and commands (`ReloadCommand`) with their corresponding fields in the language configuration.

## [1.5.4] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- Fixed a crash during SQL database initialization where MySQL/MariaDB connections threw `SQL String cannot be empty` because index queries were empty (now checks if query is blank/empty before executing).

## [1.5.3] - 2026-06-18

### Added

- Added **leaderboard caching with 45-second TTL** for improved performance across all database types.
    - Cache is automatically invalidated when user data is saved.
    - Significantly reduces load on MongoDB, JSON file system, and SQL databases.

### Improved

- **Leaderboard rendering**: Added null-safety checks to prevent crashes from corrupted user data.
- **MongoDB leaderboard**: Improved error handling with try-catch in document conversion and better logging.
- **JSON leaderboard**: Added null validation for corrupted files and improved async processing for large user datasets.
- **SQL leaderboard**: Changed error level to WARN for parse failures to reduce log noise during normal operations.
- **Error handling**: All backend database clients now log warnings instead of errors for recoverable parsing failures.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed potential NullPointerException in leaderboard menu when rendering corrupted user data.
- Fixed leaderboard cache not being invalidated after batch user saves.
- Fixed potential crash in LeaderBoardMenu.getButton() when moneyEarned data is missing.
- Fixed JSON database client filtering out users with null moneyGained map.

### Changed

- Leaderboard queries now use centralized caching layer to reduce database load.
- Cache invalidation is now automatic on all user save operations (single and batch).

## [1.5.1] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- Added the `/sts other <player> <sts>` command, allowing admins to open another player's STS menu.
- Added a button to clear all selected Pokémon in the multi-selection system.
- Selected Pokémon are now automatically cleared when the STS menu is closed.
    - This only removes the current selection state.
    - Pokémon are **not** removed from the player's party or PC storage.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added

    - Added `itemBannedMessage` to the language configuration.
- Added the ability to configure **multiple STS**, where each STS can give a different **currency type and amount**.

- Added **Multi-Selection System** for selling Pokémon:
    - Users can now select multiple Pokémon from their **Party** or **PC** boxes.

### Improved

- Added **performance optimizations**.
- Improved the **save system**, so it now only saves when necessary.
- **Cooldown duration** is now **permission-based**: uses `PlayerUtils.getCooldown` with configurable
  `cooldownPermissions` per STS instead of a hardcoded 5-minute value.
- Refactored `sellPokemon` to pass the player context, ensuring cooldown permissions are evaluated correctly at sell
  time.
